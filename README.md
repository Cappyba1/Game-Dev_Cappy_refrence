# Game-Dev_Cappy_refrence

This repository serves as an archive for game development planning, focusing on game mechanics concepts, story outlines, character profiles, and development progress.

## Directory Structure

- **design/**: The game is set in a vast map, that the player is free to explore. With no proper story to guide the narrative. I have nothing to Say at the moment. Howeve I do intend to have intersting and fun side-missions and side-quests. A lot of gameplay mechanics that are refined and also feel good to play with. lots of Bosses and various Mythiologies will be included. Three magic-Systems, one that allows the player to build their own spells or even skills.(Though that sounds like a lot of trouble, It will be done... eventually). Hidden bosses, urban legends, and even folk-tale demons.
