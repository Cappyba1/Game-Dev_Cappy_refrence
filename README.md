# Game-Dev_Cappy_refrence

This is one of my first ever repos and The purpose of this very repo is to act as an archive for the refrences that I will require in the near future.
The game is massive so the amount of refrence is also proprtional. Different game mechanics, magic systems(Three of them to be precise).
A huge map,
lots of Bosses, 
Intutive and satisfying combat system,
and much more!
